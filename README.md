# Linear-Regression

Using this [diabetes dataset (see Table 1)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/LARS/LeastAngle_2002.pdf), we construct linear predictors, calculate their error on train & test data, and visualize the prediction of our predictors. Identifying accurate predictors for the patient's status a year later would be very useful for designing and executing preventative care for the coming year and possibly reversing the course of the disease. 

Also includes an implementation of gradient descent, visualizing the results.
